# Download in release!

What this program does?
It converts MP3 to OGG, adds fadein & fadeout, writes song duration to a file name, formats the name of your file so it's compatible with Dynamo, and does that fully automatically! Just put your songs in "songs" directory and run the script, they should come out done in "converted_songs".


In case of:
1) using .py - install python(latest), add it to your path(checkbox), run in cmd "pip install pydub", run .py
2) using .exe - just run the .exe file.


FFMPEG(included in release version) is too big for such an easy task, but i don't think there is an alternative better than this. If you found one, feel free to suggest it in issue tab.
