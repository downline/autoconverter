# Download in release!

What this program does?
It converts MP3 to OGG, adds fadein & fadeout, adds song duration to a file name, and does that fully automatically! Just put your songs in "songs" directory and run the script, they should come out done in "converted_songs".


In case of:
1) using .py - install python(latest), add it to your path(checkbox), run in cmd "pip install pydub", run .py
2) using .exe - just run the .exe file.


FFMPEG(is included in only release) is too big for such an easy task, but i don't think there is an alternative better than this. If you find it, feel free to suggest it in issue tab.
