What is this?
A script that does all of described below. Meant for use in creating packs for Dynamo(https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1883617317).

What it does?
1) Add fadein's, fadeout's, set sample rate to 44100.
2) Add duration of your song in the file name.
3) Format file name of your song, in order for it to be compatible with the mod.
4) Export the result in OGG.

You can use the outdated(for now) version of autoconverter.exe, which requires no installation at all.
Or you can use the most up to date version, which is called autoconverteralpha.py. For the python file you must install python itself and pydub:
1) Install python, add it to your path by checking "add to path" box.
2) Open up cmd, type: "pip install pydub".
3) Download release, unpack it.
4) Drop dem songs in the "songs" folder, run autoconverteralpha.py, wait until the console closes, check your songs
5) ???
6) Profit, you can now do whatever you want with it. However, it's meant for easier dynamo pack making, so... yea.
